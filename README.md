# program-omegle
Simple Python script to link a Program-O bot to Omegle random chat so your bot can talk to random people.

### Running

To run the script you will need to enter the URL to your Program-O installation on line 20 as _SERVER

To start, in a terminal run

```
python ProgramOMegle.py
```

and the bot will start looking for humans to talk to, like so:

```
Starting search...
started new conversation: f5u6veaqu03442tj6dgre9mub6
Looking for humans ...
Human is typing something...
```
